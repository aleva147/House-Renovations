1) In the backend console: npm install nodemailer
2) Make the button on the frontend call the method on the backend that is copied from the nodemailer website.
   (You cannot have that method on the frontend instead of the backend).
3) Setup the Google Account to support nodemailer's services:
	- Manage your Google Account
	- Security
	- 2-Step-Verification
	- Scroll to the bottom: App passwords
	- Choose other app, name it nodemailer, and use the generated password in code you are writing. 

	- This is now a separate password for your Google Account which the nodemailer can use to access it.
	You can now treat this Google Account as the account of the web application you are creating 
	and send emails to users who have forgotten their passwords 
	(content and recipients are being set in the code, backend\src\controllers\"user.controller.ts").
	This password will be valid forever, unless you remove it yourself in the Google Account settings.
