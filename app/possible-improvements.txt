Possible Improvements:
----------------------

- Use an EventListener for detecting changes in the localStorage instead of 
  using localStorage.get() in ngOnInit and needing to reload pages.
  
  This will also protect your app from crushing when the user has multiple 
  tabs open and logs out in one of them while continuing to use the others.


- Turn the commonly used html sections into components 
  in order to drastically reduce code duplication.
  
  
- Remove duplicated code by moving it to "app.component.html":

	<div style="min-height: 100vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; background: lightslategray;">

		<app-header></app-header>

		<router-outlet></router-outlet>

		<!-- Fill Space (so that the footer is always at the bottom of the screen)-->
		<div style="flex-grow:1"></div>

		<app-footer></app-footer>

	</div>
